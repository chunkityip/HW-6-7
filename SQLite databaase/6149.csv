10/30/2019 15:10,5,5,5,3,"I have given white board interviews before and I've always had difficulty communicating my process. Alex gave a tip that we should plan the problem before we actually start solving it, I will adhere to that in my next interview.","Because most of the students in the class are always looking forward to getting an internship or a job, Alex prepared them for the interviews regarding those positions and showed them resources that would help them pass. ","I would suggest Alex to have more data on each of the slides instead of verbally stating everything. I would've loved to see him solve a problem as an example for the rest of us, to see how we should solve it the next time. ",
10/30/2019 15:10,4,3,5,5,This presentation taught me how to be a better programmer. I learned that we have to get out of our comfort zone when it comes to programming. I learned that we have to program more and do many kinds of projects in order to be better at programming. The presenter talked about tomato planner which is known as the pomodoro Technique. We should keep practicing programming because the more we practice the better we get. The fifth tip described the usage of comments and how useful comments are and it will help us understand the code better.,The presenter used PowerPoint which was very good because I like visual presentations. The presenter used examples of code which helped with the visual aid. The presenter also gave us an example of good sources for us to learn how to program better such as GeeksforGeeks. ,Some changes that the presenter can do would be the make the code pictures larger because the people in the back may not be able to see the code as clear. I also think he should try to go more in depth with the tips because he just gave simple tips when it comes to being a better programmer. ,
10/30/2019 15:10,1,1,1,2,I learned how to become a better programmer. It was useful that he gave tips on how to become a better programmer. He mentioned the tomato technique where 25 minutes is used to better understand the question. ,"I liked how he gave examples and used slides to better explain what he was talking about. Despite this, it was still very hard to keep up and understand what he was talking about. I explained it more in depth below. ",It was very hard to hear him. There was at times where I had no clue what he was talking about. He was also going too fast for me to keep up and process what he was talking about. His presentation did not seem to be too organized and looked like it was put together last minute.,
10/30/2019 15:10,5,4,4,3,"I learn new techniques like the pomodoro technique and general tips on how to become a better programmer. Learning different languages is good, however alex recommends learning one to advance level and then branching out.  He gave out some recommendations on practicing coding like hackerrank and geek for geeks. ",He used memes to get the audiences attention. He talks from his personal experience which makes his presentation easier to understand from a programming point of view. His topic is very easy to connect with because we are all programmers.   ,Maybe have some more tips or talking from past projects would be great. He went very fast and it wouuldve been nice for him to slow down and break down more. Maybe be more flexible and point out stuff. ,
10/30/2019 15:11,4,3,4,5,"It's important for a programmer to go out of his comfort zone. In order to figure out an answer you have to know the question very well so you understand what you are answering. Break apart your problem into question, quesdocode, and code.",The presenter did include an entertaining presentation that wasn't just a speech but featured some pictures and jokes and tried to demonstrate his way of programming which makes a lot of sense for efficiency and break time.,Perhaps a more interactive presentation would benefit the main idea of becoming a better programmer. Perhaps also look at the audience more and not include as many joke pictures. Maybe do an example of a coding challenge to see.,
10/30/2019 15:11,5,5,5,5,"He suggests we study one language as the main focus instead of studying multiple languages and not knowing even one language well. Get out of your comfort zone and do something practical with the language to gain experience. You should also plan before you program instead of just jumping into programming. First try to understand the problem, then do pseudo-code, then actually writing the code. By doing this, you make it easier and more efficient. The more you practice the better you'll be at the language. Gives websites to help practice, HackerRank, GeekforGeeks, and leetcode. You should also write comments to explain what the code is doing so you and other people understand what's going on. ","The presenter was able to properly lay out his advice into a list of separate steps. For example, first was learn one language, then gain experience with that language, then plan ahead, etc. By doing this we can take in each tip and understand his points.","Maybe try to provide more information on the slides themselves, as many of the slides contained minimal information for the topic. Sometimes we need better examples to fully understand what he was trying to explain. ",
10/30/2019 15:11,4,3,5,2,"I was already very familiar with many of the programming tips in the presentation. The advice was fairly generic and easy to find on platforms such as YouTube, but useful anyway. I realized that my fairly narrow focus in terms of languages and technologies right now is perfectly fine. ","The presenter was not afraid to use humor to make the presentation more personal, because the topic should relate to programmers on a personal level. He also seemed interested in his topic and the information was relevant to his life.","The presenter should probably look for tips that are more counter intuitive or well researched. He could have studied and mentioned different learning techniques that are supported by studies, not just the pomodoro method. ",
10/30/2019 15:12,3,3,4,3,"The ""pomodoro"" technique for learning programming, how to divide your time in order to best learn how to be a better programmer. How to focus on just learning one programming language thoroughly and spend time not only writing code but reading code, writing pseudocode, writing comments, and learning command line commands as well. ","He was very thorough in his description, his presentation was well organized and he was passionate about the topic at hand. I liked that he not only introduced concepts but explained them as well. I also liked how he broke for audience questions at the end.","He brushed through some topics faster than others, like the discussion of the ""pomodoro"" technique was more in depth than his discussion of the use of command line which was far more brief. It would be nice if he focused the same amount of time and effort evenly throughout the presentation.",
10/30/2019 15:12,3,2,3,2,I honestly didn't really learn anything from this presentation. The topic was simple and most of us already knew what he talked about. I also could barely understand and hear what he was saying half the time.,"Something that worked well for the presentation was that the presenter wasn't reading from the slides. A lot of the time, presentations have all the information on the slides and the presenter just reads from it. It is better to not write that much on the slides and talk from knowledge rather than reading straight from the slides.","Speak louder. I could barely hear the presenter from the back of the room and I didn't really get what he was trying to present. The presentation was also a bit short and the topic was too simple. A lot of what he talked about, a lot of us already knew.",
10/30/2019 15:12,5,5,5,5,"The presentation was about how to become a better programmer. The presenter gave a lot of suggestions on detail things that we already know but wouldn't do. In order to become a better programmer, as the presenter said, we have to get out of our comfort zone, practice more and pay attention to the details","In the presentation, the presenter inserted some funny images and statements in between the suggestions, some funny things that only programmer knows. That is a good technique to get the audience attentions and not let them get bored.","I would say to speak a little louder, because the room is big, and i sit close to the back, i need to pay more attention than usual to hear and understand what the presenter said. Everything else is good.",Nice topic
10/30/2019 15:14,4,3,2,3,There are different resources that can be used to become a better programmer. you  need to spend time working on it every day even if it is for a short time.                                                ,He brought in his own experiences and what he has learned and what worked for him.  It would have been good if he said which resource worked best for him and why .                                          ,Use more details. pros and cons of each website and why he thinks they are pros and cons. more details on why these resources are important                                                                ,
10/30/2019 15:15,4,3,4,4,I learned more about the Pomodoro Technique. I am going to try to implement this method with my studies because I struggle with staying focused. Breaking work that I have to do into intervals could really improve my work flow. ,I feel like his power point was well put together and he had something visual  such as some lines of code too show us to make his presentation more appealing. I also liked that he implemented memes into his presentation. ,"It was bit hard to hear him from the back. Speaking a little bit louder could have made it easier for others in the back to hear what he was saying. Also, some of his slides could have had more information so that I could follow with what he was saying. ",
10/30/2019 15:17,5,2,5,5,Something new I learned from this presentation that I didn't know before that there are websites for code challenges where can you sharpen up your thinking skills. This will motivate me to go to these websites to start practicing.,I felt like the photos in his slides were really good. His slides had a lot of information where I was able to read most of because I couldn?€?t really hear much from the presentation. Other than that his PowerPoint was very informative.,One thing I would advise the presenter would suggest would be to speak a little louder because I had a hard time hearing him clearly. Also I would suggest to show the websites of these programming codes challenges so we are able to go to in our free time.,Great work !
10/30/2019 15:18,5,5,5,5,"tip 1, I knew it already. I am now focused on C#. He is right that more programming languages now, focus on one language now is much easier for us to learn, and done something. For the other tips, they really make me think deep for them. ","His topic opened my mind. Let me, a beginner, think deeply what we should do or focus on. emm...200 character is too much for this question, so I really do not know what to write for more. His topic is good.","If his voice becomes louder then it is much better for us to hear what he said. And seems like his presentation is a little bit less. he can add more for his presentation then it is much better, I think. ",
10/30/2019 15:20,3,3,3,3,"Majority of what was discussed in the presentation was what we sort of learned throughout the CS major, additionally I would say I learned what all CS majors or even individuals who want to code should do when starting out","What worked well was the memes, I think they were entertaining and it kept the audience to pay attention, the memes were relatable to most students in CS. Lastly, the outline of the presentation was straight forward.","What I would change is go more in depth as to what you should learn. What I mean by that is, if someone wants to become a front end developer or backend engineer or even a full stack developer. What specific technologies/languages should they get in to?",
10/30/2019 15:22,4,4,5,4,"Most of the tips that the presenter explained, I already knew before. However, he explained the tomato planner, which I have not heard of and will attempt applying it to my projects. The tomato planner is a plan in which you take 25 minutes to understand the code, 5 minutes to rest, 25minutes to write pseudocode, 5 minutes to rest and then 25minutes to write the code, and so on until your project is complete. ",The presenter knew his topic very well and organized it by tips to become a better programmer.  He organized each slide by the summary of the tip and then explained it on his own. He also gave examples of code and how each tip is applied. ,"I don?€?t really have any suggestions for improvement; I do however like that he included examples of websites in which we can apply all of these tips, by practicing our code. I will definitely implement these tips when I am working on a project,",
10/30/2019 15:23,5,4,5,2,"I knew most of the point the presenter made with his presentation, but one thing i didn't know in particular was methods or techniques that help you. One thing the presenter mentioned was Tomato technique to break down your time to solve some question. 25 minutes to understand the problem, 5 minutes testing, 25 minutes pseudocode,  5 minutes resting and 25 minutes to write the code. i never though of using techniques to break down my time to solve a problem.",The presenter used meme pictures to show a stereotypical programmer and it drove the point across by showing what a lazy or a bad programmer is like. The presenter also used code snippet examples of what undocumented code looks like vs how much easier it is to understand code when its documented. The presenter showed techniques to use to break down a problem into different times.,"The presenter did well with their presentation, but sometimes it was hard to understand what the speaker was saying because they talked a little low and fast but other than that the presenter had an organized presentation.",
11/1/2019 11:59,3,5,4,4,I have learned that a person should focus learning on one language rather than multiple. This helps the programmer be more efficient on one language instead of being inexperience on all of the other languages.,"The presenter was able to clearly explain each tip that he presented to us. He also gave us a small plan for tip #3, which is a breakdown of how a programmer should plan to write the code within a time limit.","Tip #2 and #4 should be combined into one tip because they both give the same advice, where people should practice programming to become better at it. Another improvement for the presenter is to make sure that there are not any typos in the presentation. I saw one of the slides said ""The more you do, it better"" rather than ""The more you do, the better.""",
11/2/2019 14:14,5,5,5,5,"Fo this presentation, I will learn the two states of every programmer and study the language. This presentation teach about create a personal website put in to the resume make the resume look better. Each program need plan the idea before to create the project.","For this presentation, the presenter teach us every programmer need spend 25 mins to write a pseudocode in each program. Presenter share his idea and experience for each programing language, and keep leaning new programming language.","For this presentation,  presenter should be give more background and video tell us more idea for be the better programmer.  Presenter should  be get some information about the programming language, and provide a little more detail about the presentation.",
11/2/2019 16:44,5,5,5,2,"The goal of the presentation was to give us some tips of how to become a better programmer. The presenter did a good job explaining the strategy to become a better programmer, however I already knew most of the explained material. Nevertheless I learned about some of the great tools/coding sources that I didn't know before like ""Tomato planner"" and ""Code Wars"". ","Some of the good methodologies the presenter used were:

- Clear explanation with useful tips
- Mentioned useful sources like hacker-rank, geek for geeks, code-wars and leetcode
- Used examples with code to demonstrate the importance of comments
- Sharing personal experience
- Used funny memes","While there is always room for improvement, I suppose that for this specific presentation the presenter covered all the content required to make us understand how to become a better programmer. I can't think of any suggestions to make this presentation more effective.",Excellent presentation with useful examples and tips. Thank you! 
11/3/2019 21:03,5,4,4,4,"I've learned that as programmers we need to plan for ourselves. The first step is to choose one language to master rather than multiple languages. In peacetime to do regular exercises, to maintain our state. In addition, challenge the difficulties bravely and think more. Use comments when writing code to help you remember and organize the program.","The presenter thinks and understands the content of the presentation very well, and is able to give the important content directly. The content has a great attraction for students. During the speech, a large number of practical examples were given to help students understand and learn.","I want the speaker to review more before the presentation. This can effectively improve the fluency of the presentation, and reduce the case of forgetting the content. It is best to give negative examples when making suggestions to show the benefits they can bring.",
11/4/2019 12:56,4,3,5,3,I did not learn a lot but it reminded me about mastering only one language and don't jump to other languages. That we need to get out of our comfy zone and we have to practice coding every day. Also Alex briefly reminded us that we need to plan before doing an actual coding. ,I would say that detailed slides worked really well because sometimes it was kind of hard to understand what Alex wanted to tell us. Also he gave us some very useful examples of the website where we can practice our coding for job interview.,"I would suggest to try to be more calm and talk a little slower. I understand that English is not his first language but he needs to try to speak more clearly and needs to stop using word ""like"" all the time.",
11/7/2019 21:45,5,5,5,5,"In order to be a good programmer we need to focus on one language first, get out the comfy zone, plan before you do. Understand the question first and try to write a  pseudo code. Introduced some website that help to write the code and do the practice question.",He gives example question form the website. And tell us how he solve the question step by step. Clear presentation of the topic. Lots of intuitive explanation of the topic.The Powerpoint is very clear and easy to read.,"Lecture style was slow. He can show more example of different kinds of interview questions. He could speak more slowly and the presentation will be vastly improved-- because the speed with which you speak affects all aspect of the presentation, including audience understanding and mood.
